# Instructions for Competitors: How to Fork the Repository, Add Collaborators, and Submit Your Code

## Step 1: Fork the Original Repository
1. If using your own repository, skip this step.
   
3. Go to the main page of this repository.
   
4. In the top right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button. This will create a **copy** of the repository in your GitHub account.

5. Once the fork is complete, you’ll have a new repository under your GitHub account:
   - `https://github.com/your-username/programmingcompetition-repo` (this will be your fork).

## Step 2: Add the Organizers as Collaborators
1. Navigate to **your forked repository** on GitHub (the one you just created after forking).
   
2. In the top right corner of the page, click on the **Settings** tab.

3. In the left sidebar, click **Collaborators & teams**.

4. Under the "Collaborators" section, click **Add people**.

5. In the search bar, enter the **@joyaa16** and **@OrionWiersma**, and select the organizer’s account from the search results.

6. Click **Add** to send the invitation.

## Step 3: Work on Your Code
1. Clone your forked repository (or personal) to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/programming-competition-repo.git

2. Make changes to the code, add any files (like presentations, reports, etc.), and commit your work to your fork.

3. Important: Always remember to push your changes to GitHub as you go. Use the following commands in your terminal:

   Commit your changes:
     ```bash 
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

Push your changes to your fork:
    
    git push origin main
## Step 4: Submit Your Final Code Before the Deadline

1. When you're done with your code and any other files (such as presentations), make sure everything is pushed to the main branch of your forked repository before the deadline (5:30pm AST).

2. Ensure all your code is in the main branch and you have added all necessary files (e.g., code, presentation, reports).

3. You do not need to create a pull request (PR) at this point. We will access your code directly as a collaborator on your repo.

4. Once you’ve pushed your final changes, you’re ready to submit your code. The organizers will be able to review your code from your fork.
